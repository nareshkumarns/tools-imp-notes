🔧 What is DevOps?
##########################################
DevOps is a combination of two words:

Dev = Development (writing code)

Ops = Operations (managing infrastructure, deployment, and monitoring)

👉 DevOps is a culture, set of practices, and tools that aim to:

Bridge the gap between development and operations teams, so software can be built, tested, and released faster, more reliably, and continuously.


🎯 Main Goals of DevOps
#####################################
Faster delivery of software

Automation of processes (build, test, deploy)

Improved collaboration between teams

Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)

Higher software quality with fewer bugs

Rapid recovery from failures

🏢 What is IT Infrastructure?
#####################################

IT Infrastructure refers to the basic physical and virtual resources required to run and manage IT services and software applications.

✅ In simple terms:

It's everything you need to host, run, connect, store, protect, and manage your software and data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💻 Components of IT Infrastructure
################################################

When you're setting up a software company (or any IT service), you need several core resources:

a) 🖥️ Machines (Servers & Computers)
Physical or virtual servers that run applications

Developer/employee laptops, desktops

b) 🌐 Network
Routers, switches, firewalls, internet connections

Ensures all systems can communicate securely and efficiently

c) ⚡ Power
Reliable electricity supply, UPS, generators

Keeps systems running 24/7

d) 💾 Storage
Hard drives, SSDs

Stores your application code, databases, files, and backups

e) 🛡️ Backup
Systems to regularly copy and save important data

Protects from data loss due to failure, attacks, or mistakes

f) 🔐 Security
Firewalls, antivirus, encryption, access controls

Protects systems and data from unauthorized access or cyberattacks

🧠 Summary
All these components together make up the IT Infrastructure – the foundation needed to build and run software services smoothly and securely.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


🏢 What is On-Prem Infrastructure?
#################################################
On-Premises (On-Prem) infrastructure means:
-> You buy, own, and manage all your IT resources physically at your location (like office or data center).

🔧 You are responsible for:
a. Buying hardware (servers, routers, storage)

b. Setting up network, power backup

c. Hiring IT staff for maintenance

d. Handling security, repairs, and upgrades

⚠️ Challenges with On-Prem Infrastructure
################################################
💰 High Initial Investment – You have to buy everything upfront (costly!)

👨‍🔧 High Manpower – You need skilled IT people to manage it

📈 Scalability is Hard – Difficult to increase/decrease capacity quickly

🔌 Availability – System failures = downtime

🌐 Network Issues – You manage your own connections

🔐 Security Issues – You are responsible for data protection
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


☁️ What is Cloud Computing?
################################
Cloud computing is the delivery of IT resources like servers, storage, databases, and software over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis.

🔑 Key Idea:
You rent resources from cloud providers when you need them, instead of buying.

✅ Benefits of Cloud Computing

☁️ Cloud Service Models
Cloud providers offer different levels of services depending on how much control and responsibility you want. These models are:

IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service

PaaS – Platform as a Service

SaaS – Software as a Service


🧱 What is IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)?
####################################################
-> IaaS is a cloud service model where the cloud provider gives you raw infrastructure, and you build everything on top of it.

🏗️ Think of it like:
"You rent a fully functional empty building, and it’s your job to furnish it, decorate it, and use it however you want."

✅ What the cloud provider gives you:
---------------------------------------------
🖥️ Virtual Machines (VMs)

🌐 Networking (IP, firewall, load balancer)

💾 Storage (hard drives, SSDs)

⚙️ Virtualization, Servers, Data Center

✅ What you (the customer) have to do:
------------------------------------------------
Install Operating System (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows)

Install runtime environments (Java, Python, Node.js, etc.)

Set up web servers (Apache, Nginx, Tomcat, etc.)

Deploy and manage your application code

Handle updates, patches, and security

📦 Example Scenario
----------------------------------
Let’s say you want to host a Java web application.

Using IaaS:
------------
You create a VM on AWS EC2

Install Ubuntu

Install Java, Tomcat, MySQL

Deploy your .war file

Configure your firewall, ports, etc.

🔧 Common IaaS Providers
Provider		Service Example
AWS			EC2, EBS, VPC
Microsoft Azure		Virtual Machines
Google Cloud		Compute Engine
Oracle Cloud		OCI Compute
DigitalOcean		Droplets

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

⚙️ What is PaaS (Platform as a Service)?
#############################################
PaaS is a cloud service model where the cloud provider gives you a ready-made platform (runtime, OS, web server, etc.) so that you can directly deploy and run your application — without worrying about setting up servers or infrastructure.

🎯 Key Idea:
You focus only on developing and deploying your code, and the cloud provider takes care of the platform and infrastructure underneath.

✅ What the cloud provider gives you:
----------------------------------------
Pre-installed OS

Runtime environment (like Java, Node.js, Python)

Web server (e.g., Apache, Tomcat)

Auto-scaling, load balancing, and patching

Built-in monitoring and logging

✅ What you (the customer) need to do:
----------------------------------------
Write your application code

Upload/deploy your app on the platform

Manage your data, and maybe configure some settings

You don’t need to:

Install OS

Set up web servers

Configure runtime manually

📦 Example Scenario
------------------------
Let’s say you want to deploy a Java Spring Boot application.

Using PaaS:

Choose a PaaS provider like Heroku or Google App Engine

Push your code using Git

The platform automatically:

Sets up the Java environment

Deploys your app

Manages scaling and traffic

You just monitor it and update the code when needed.

☁️ Popular PaaS Providers
Provider				Service Example
Heroku				Easy app deployment (multi-language)
Google App Engine		Run apps without managing servers
AWS Elastic Beanstalk		Deploy web apps in Java, .NET, PHP, etc.
Microsoft Azure App Service	Deploy and scale web apps easily

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💻 What is SaaS (Software as a Service)?
####################################################
SaaS is a cloud service model where the cloud provider gives you ready-to-use software, and you can access it through the internet — no installation, no setup, no servers.

🎯 Key Idea:
You simply use the software; everything else — like servers, updates, backups, and security — is managed by the cloud provider.

✅ What the cloud provider handles:
------------------------------------------
Application software

Servers and infrastructure

Updates and bug fixes

Data storage and backup

Security and availability

✅ What you (the customer) do:
--------------------------------------------
Just log in to the app (usually in a browser)

Use it to manage your tasks, documents, communication, etc.

Pay monthly/yearly (subscription)

📌 No need to install, manage, or update anything.

📦 Example SaaS Applications
App					Purpose
Zoom				Video meetings and communication
Google Drive / Docs		File storage, editing, collaboration
Dropbox	Cloud 			storage
Microsoft 365 (Teams, Word)	Productivity & collaboration

🌐 AWS Global Infrastructure
To deliver fast, reliable, and secure services, AWS has a global infrastructure. Here's how it's structured:

✅ Region
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Region is a geographic area (e.g., US-East, Asia-Pacific, Europe)

Each region contains multiple data centers

Examples: us-east-1 (N. Virginia), ap-south-1 (Mumbai)

🟢 Currently: 33 AWS Regions (and still growing)

✅ Availability Zone (AZ)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each region has multiple Availability Zones

An AZ is basically a separate data center with its own power, networking, and cooling

AZs in the same region are connected with high-speed networks

Designed for high availability & fault tolerance

🟢 Currently: 105 Availability Zones
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔧 Why This Global Setup Matters
--------------------------------------------------
Feature				Benefit

🌍 Global Reach		Deploy apps close to your users

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

☁️ Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - AWS Service
##############################################################
EC2 is one of the most demanded services in AWS. It allows you to create virtual machines (VMs) in the AWS cloud, which are called EC2 instances.

✅ Key Points about EC2:
-----------------------------------------
What is an EC2 Instance?
-------------------------------------------------
EC2 Instance = Virtual Machine (VM) or Server (you can think of it as a computer that runs on the cloud).

It’s resizable, meaning you can change the configuration of your EC2 instance (e.g., CPU, RAM) based on the demand (if your workload increases, you can scale up).

Billing:
--------------------------------------------
Hourly billing: You pay for the time your EC2 instance runs, by the hour.

Minimum billing period is 1 hour. Even if you use it for less than 1 hour, you'll be billed for a full hour.

Example: If you run your EC2 instance for 15 minutes, you'll still be billed for 1 hour.

Note: AWS offers free tier access for beginners, like the t2.micro/t3.micro instance, which allows 750 hours per month for one year.

Storage:
--------------------------------------------------
EBS (Elastic Block Storage) is used to store data for EC2 instances.

Windows EC2 instances come with a default storage of 30 GB.

Linux EC2 instances come with a default storage of 8 GB.

Maximum EBS volume size is 16 TB (16,000 GB).

Networking:
-----------------------------------------------------------
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) service is used to manage the network for EC2 instances.

VPC helps you define private networks and security controls for your EC2 instances.

Creating EC2 Instances:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
To create an EC2 instance, you use an AMI (Amazon Machine Image).

AMI is a pre-configured template that contains the operating system and software required for your EC2 instance.

Examples of AMIs:

Windows AMI

Amazon Linux AMI

Ubuntu AMI

Red Hat AMI

Security:
----------------------------------------------
To secure your EC2 instance, you use Key-Pairs:

Key Pair is a set of public and private keys used for SSH (Secure Shell) login.

One Key Pair can be used for multiple EC2 instances.

For controlling access to your EC2 instance (allowing or restricting traffic), you use Security Groups.

Security Groups act like firewalls to define which incoming and outgoing traffic is allowed.

One Security Group can be assigned to multiple EC2 instances.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating Windows ec2 instance and connecting with it
###########################################################################
1) Create Key Pair (.pem file)
A Key Pair is used for secure login into your EC2 instance.

Public Key: This stays with AWS. It is embedded into the EC2 instance during launch.

Private Key (.pem): You download this. Keep it safe — you’ll need it to access the instance.

🔐 If you lose the .pem file, you cannot connect to your instance unless you've already added another user or created a new key pair and updated it manually.

2) Create Security Group and update Inbound Rules to allow traffic
A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance. You must allow necessary traffic by adding inbound rules:

Protocol	Port	Purpose
RDP	3389	For Windows GUI access
SSH	22	For Linux terminal access
HTTP	80	For web traffic
HTTPS	443	For secure web traffic
MySQL	3306	For database connections
🔒 Best practice: Restrict access by IP instead of using 0.0.0.0/0 (which means open to all).

3) Create EC2 Instance
Steps to launch your instance:

✅ Select AMI: Choose Windows AMI if you want a GUI (e.g., Windows Server 2019).

✅ Select Instance Type: Example — t2.micro (eligible for free tier).

✅ Select Key Pair: Choose the one you created in Step 1.

✅ Select Security Group: Use the one created in Step 2.

✅ Configure Storage: Add/modify EBS Volume (root disk size, additional volumes if needed).

✅ Launch Instance: Review and click Launch.

4) Connect to EC2 instance using RDP client
Once your Windows instance is running:

➤ Steps to Connect via RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol):
Go to EC2 Console → Instances → Select your instance.

Click on Connect → RDP Client tab.

Download the Remote Desktop File (.rdp).

Click Get Password → Upload your .pem file to decrypt the password.

Open the .rdp file → Enter the username (usually Administrator) and decrypted password.

Accept the certificate warning → You’ll be logged into your Windows EC2 instance.

Types of IPs in AWS Cloud
===============================
✅ We have 3 types of IPs in AWS:
1) Private IP
Fixed inside a VPC

Used for internal communication between EC2s

🔹 Example:
private ip : 172.31.34.139

2) Public IP
Dynamic, assigned by AWS when instance is launched

Changes when instance is stopped and started

🔹 Example:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
public ip : 13.127.100.70   (before restart)  
public ip : 13.201.59.162   (after restart)
3) Elastic IP
A static public IP allocated to your AWS account

You can associate it with any EC2 instance

Remains unchanged even after restarts

Charged if not associated with a running instance

🔹 Example:
Elastic IP : 3.6.99.192

###############################
Practicals on Elastic IP
##############################
Step-1: Allocate Elastic IP
Go to EC2 Console > Network & Security > Elastic IPs

Click Allocate Elastic IP

AWS provides you an Elastic IP:
✅ Elastic IP: 15.207.12.111

Step-2: Associate Elastic IP with EC2 VM
Choose your instance → Actions → Associate Elastic IP

Select your new Elastic IP

Associate it with your EC2 instance

Step-3: Restart the EC2 VM
Stop and Start the EC2 instance

Verify the public IP remains the same:
✅ Elastic IP: 15.207.12.111 (Still same after restart)

Step-4: De-Associate Elastic IP
Go to Elastic IPs → Select the IP → Actions → Disassociate

Step-5: Release Elastic IP (to avoid billing)
After disassociating, go to Elastic IPs

Select the IP → Actions → Release Elastic IP

This frees the IP and prevents unnecessary charges
#######################################################################
✅ What is EBS?
EBS stands for Elastic Block Store.

Think of it like a hard disk or SSD that you attach to your EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance.

✅ How does EBS work with EC2?
When you create an EC2 instance, an EBS volume is created automatically – this is usually your Root Volume.

This Root Volume contains the Operating System (OS).

📝 Important Note:

If you remove the EBS Root Volume, the EC2 instance will not work because there's no OS to boot from.

✅ Types of EBS Volumes:
1. Root Volume:

-> Mandatory for EC2 to run.
-> Created by default when you launch an EC2 instance.
-> Stores the OS and essential boot files.

2. Additional Volume:
-> Optional.
-> You can add these for extra storage (e.g., for data, backups, applications).
-> Can be attached or removed as needed.

✅ Default EBS Volume Sizes:
-> Windows EC2 Instance: 30 GB by default.
-> Linux EC2 Instance: 8 GB by default.

✅ EBS Volume Size Limits:
-> Normal EBS Volume: Up to 16 TB.
-> High-performance io2 (Provisioned IOPS): Up to 65 TB.

✅ Other Key Points:
-> You can attach multiple EBS volumes to a single EC2 instance.
-> However, one EBS volume can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time.
-> EBS volumes are Availability Zone (AZ) specific, which means:
-> You can only attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance in the same AZ.

📍 Example:
-> If your EC2 instance is in ap-south-1a (Mumbai), you can only attach EBS volumes in ap-south-1a, not in ap-south-1b or ap-south-1c.

#################################################################################################
Types of EBS volumes, explaining them in simple terms along with their use cases and size limits:
###################################################################################################

✅ 1) General Purpose SSD (gp3 / gp2)
Min: 1 GiB
Max: 16,384 GiB (16 TB)
Use Case: Best for everyday use, such as running your OS, boot volumes, and general workloads.

💡 Good for:
Web servers
Small to medium databases
Development and testing environments

📌 gp3 is newer and offers better performance at a lower cost compared to gp2.

✅ 2) Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 / io2)
io1: Min 4 GiB, Max 16,384 GiB
io2: Min 4 GiB, Max 65,536 GiB (65 TB)
Use Case: Best for high-performance databases and applications that need consistent and fast I/O.

💡 Good for:
Mission-critical databases (like Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL)
High-performance workloads (financial systems, analytics, etc.)

🔧 You can provision the number of IOPS (input/output operations per second) for predictable performance.

✅ 3) Cold HDD (sc1)
Min: 125 GiB
Max: 16,384 GiB
Use Case: Designed for infrequently accessed data.

💡 Good for:
Backup storage
Archival storage
Large volumes of rarely accessed files

📉 Lowest cost per GB, but also lowest performance.

✅ 4) Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
Min: 125 GiB
Max: 16,384 GiB
Use Case: Ideal for large, sequential workloads.

💡 Good for:
Big data
Data warehouses
Streaming log data
Large-scale file systems

📊 Focus is on throughput (MB/s), not IOPS.

✅ 5) Magnetic (Standard) (legacy, rarely used now)
Min: 1 GiB
Max: 1,024 GiB (1 TB)
Use Case: Old-generation storage type. Mostly used in the past for low-cost workloads.

💡 Good for:
Small, infrequent workloads
Archival (only if legacy reasons force it)

⚠️ Slow performance, not recommended for modern EC2 setups.

#################
Practicals on EBS
######################
1) Create EC2 VM (VM-1)
OS: Amazon Linux AMI.

When you create the EC2 instance, it will have an EBS root volume of 8 GB by default.

2) Create Additional EBS Volume (10 GB)
Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
Under Elastic Block Store, select Volumes and create a new volume with the following properties:
Size: 10 GB
Availability Zone: Ensure you select the same Availability Zone (AZ) as VM-1 (e.g., ap-south-1a).

3) Attach Additional Volume to EC2 VM-1
After creating the additional EBS volume, right-click on it and select Attach.
Choose the instance VM-1 and attach the volume to it (typically as /dev/xvdb).

4) Connect with VM-1 and Check Volumes Attached
SSH into VM-1 using the key pair you created during the EC2 instance launch.
Once logged in, check the attached volumes with the following command:

$ lsblk

The output should list both the root volume (e.g., /dev/xvda) and the additional volume (e.g., /dev/xvdb).

5) Store Data in Additional Volume by Mounting
Format the additional volume to use the ext4 file system:
$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb

Create a mount directory for the additional volume:
$ mkdir psa

Mount the volume to the psa directory:
$ sudo mount /dev/xvdb psa

Change into the psa directory and create files to store data:
$ cd psa
$ sudo touch f1.txt f2.txt

This step creates two text files: f1.txt and f2.txt on the additional volume.

6) Detach Additional Volume from EC2 VM-1
Go back to the EC2 Dashboard, select Volumes, find the additional volume (/dev/xvdb), and detach it from VM-1.

7) Create a New EC2 VM (VM-2)
Launch a new EC2 instance (VM-2) with the same Amazon Linux AMI or any other OS.
Ensure VM-2 is in the same AZ as VM-1 for volume attachment.

8) Attach Additional Volume to EC2 VM-2
Attach the previously detached additional volume (from VM-1) to VM-2.
It will show up as /dev/xvdb (or another name, depending on the device name you selected).

9) Check the Data on the Volume
SSH into VM-2.

Run the following command to check the attached volumes:
$ lsblk

Mount the additional volume (/dev/xvdb) to a new directory:

$ mkdir demo
$ sudo mount /dev/xvdb demo

Now, check the files:
$ ls -l demo

You should see f1.txt and f2.txt in the demo directory, confirming the data was preserved even after detaching and reattaching the volume.

Conclusion:
You have successfully:
-> Created and attached an EBS additional volume.
-> Stored data in the volume.
-> Detached and reattached the volume to a new EC2 instance.
-> Verified that the data persisted.

####################################
📸 What is a Snapshot in AWS?
####################################

A Snapshot is a backup of an EBS volume.

It captures the entire state (data + configuration) of the volume at the time the snapshot was taken.

Think of it like taking a photo of your hard disk — you can later use that photo to recreate the disk if needed.

✅ Key Characteristics:
✅ Snapshots are region-specific

Note: You can only create and use snapshots within the same AWS region.
Note: But! You can copy a snapshot to another region if needed for disaster recovery or migration.

✅ Volumes are Availability Zone (AZ) specific

You can only attach a volume to an EC2 instance in the same AZ.

🔄 Volume ↔ Snapshot Workflow
▶️ From Volume → Snapshot:
You can create a snapshot of an existing EBS volume.

This is commonly used for backup, cloning, or restoring volumes.

▶️ From Snapshot → Volume:
You can create a new EBS volume from the snapshot at any time.

That new volume will have the same data as when the snapshot was taken.

🌀 So the full lifecycle looks like this:


NOte: Volume  ➝  Snapshot  ➝  Volume

You can even create multiple volumes from a single snapshot if you need multiple copies.

🚫 Can Snapshots be Attached to EC2?
❌ No, snapshots cannot be attached directly to EC2 instances.

✅ You must first create a volume from the snapshot, then you can attach that volume to your EC2 instance.

💡 Think of it like this:

A snapshot is just a stored image of a disk. You can't run it or mount it directly. You have to turn it into a usable disk (volume) first.

📝 Use Cases for Snapshots:
-> Backup and restore EBS volumes
-> Creating new EC2 instances with preloaded data
-> Moving data across regions (by copying snapshots)
-> Creating AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)

✅ Q) How to copy data from 1a zone VM to 1b zone VM?
########################################################
▶️ Step-by-Step Explanation:
🧱 Step 1: Create a snapshot of the volume attached to 1a VM
A snapshot is like a backup image of your EBS volume. It’s stored in S3 (behind the scenes), and snapshots are region-wide, meaning they can be used in any AZ within the same region.

🧱 Step 2: Create a new volume from that snapshot in the 1b AZ
Now use that snapshot to create a new EBS volume, but place it in the 1b zone.

🧱 Step 3: Attach the new 1b volume to your 1b VM
Now that the volume exists in 1b, attach it to the EC2 instance in that zone.

🔄 What is Lifecycle Manager?
############################################
Lifecycle Manager helps you:

📸 Automatically take snapshots of EBS volumes (backups)
🧹 Retain them based on rules (e.g., last 7 daily snapshots)
🗑️ Delete old ones automatically

It’s useful for data protection, disaster recovery, and backup compliance.

✅ Steps to Create a Lifecycle Policy (Using AWS Console)
🔹 Step 1: Go to Lifecycle Manager
Open the EC2 Dashboard
On the left menu, click "Lifecycle Manager"
Click “Create lifecycle policy”

🔹 Step 2: Choose Policy Type
Choose “EBS Snapshot Policy”
Click Next

🔹 Step 3: Target Resources (Volumes)
You select which EBS volumes to back up based on tags

Example:
Tag Key: Backup
Tag Value: Daily

Only volumes with this tag will be included in the backup.

📌 So make sure your volumes are tagged properly.

🔹 Step 4: Create Schedule
Define how often you want the snapshots:


Field	Example
Frequency	Daily, Weekly, Monthly
Start time	2:00 AM UTC
Retention	Keep last 7 snapshots
Copy tags	Optional (copies volume tags to snapshot)
You can also enable Fast Snapshot Restore or Cross-Region Copy (for DR setups).

🔹 Step 5: Tags for the Policy
Give the policy itself a tag if needed (optional).

🔹 Step 6: Review and Create
Review all settings

Click Create policy

Done ✅ — AWS will now take snapshots automatically based on your settings!

🧠 Example Use Case
---------------------------------
Let's say you want to:

Backup all volumes tagged with Backup=Daily
Take snapshots every day at 1:00 AM
Retain the last 5 backups
Delete older ones automatically
You just set that up once, and AWS handles it every day. Zero manual work.

✅ 1) What is User Data in EC2?
#########################################
💡 Definition:
User data is a startup script (bash, cloud-init, etc.) you provide when launching an EC2 instance. It runs automatically once when the instance boots for the first time.

🛠️ Example Use Case:
Install Apache and host a webpage automatically.

#!/bin/bash
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Pankaj Sir Academy - 1</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

✅ Features:
Runs only once (at first boot)
Ideal for installing packages, configuring software, setting up environments

💥 What the script does:
-------------------------------
sudo su – switches to root
yum install httpd -y – installs Apache web server
cd /var/www/html – goes to default website root directory
echo ... > index.html – creates a basic HTML file
service httpd start – starts the web server

🌐 To Access the Website:
-------------------------------
After the instance starts:
Go to the Security Group → Inbound Rules
Allow traffic on port 80 (HTTP) from Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
Open browser and type: http://<your-ec2-public-ip>

🔄 What is a Load Balancer?
#################################
A Load Balancer is a system that automatically distributes incoming network or application traffic across multiple servers (or instances) to ensure no single server is overloaded with user request.

❌ The Problem Without Load Balancer (Single Server Issues):
When you host your application on one server only, you face:

💥 All traffic goes to one place — server overload

🐌 Increased users = slow response

⚠️ If that server crashes, your app goes offline

🛑 This is called a Single Point of Failure

📉 Business impact — users can’t access services

✅ Solution: Load Balancer
A Load Balancer fixes these problems by:

🧠 Smartly distributing traffic across multiple servers

🔁 Uses Round Robin (or other algorithms) to share requests

🧩 Automatically skips unhealthy servers

✅ Benefits of Load Balancer (You wrote it well — here’s a quick enhancement):
###############################################################################
No.	Benefit	Explanation
1️⃣	App runs on multiple servers -	Redundancy and scalability
2️⃣	Load is distributed	 - No single server is overwhelmed
3️⃣	Reduced burden on servers - 	Servers share the work
4️⃣	Faster performance	 - Better response time for users
5️⃣	High availability	 - If one server fails, others still serve users

🧪 Load Balancer Lab Task – Step-by-Step Explanation
#########################################################
✅ Step-1: Create EC2 VM-1 with User Data
This instance will act as Server-1 running a simple static webpage.

#!/bin/bash
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Pankaj Sir Academy - 1</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

🛠️ What this does:
Installs Apache web server
Writes HTML into /var/www/html/index.html
Starts the Apache server so it can serve requests on port 80

✅ Step-2: Create EC2 VM-2 with Similar User Data (but different content)

#!/bin/bash
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Pankaj Sir Academy - 2</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

🧠 This makes sure both servers are functionally the same, but you can identify which one responds by looking at the response (Server - 1 or Server - 2).

✅ Step-3: Create a Target Group and Add EC2s
📌 A Target Group is a collection of EC2 instances that a Load Balancer can forward traffic to.

While creating the Target Group:
Type: Instance
Protocol: HTTP
Port: 80
VPC: same VPC as EC2s
Health Check Path: / (default is fine)
Add both EC2s to the target group and register them

💡 This links your servers to the Load Balancer.

✅ Step-4: Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Key settings:
Scheme: Internet-facing (so it’s publicly accessible)
Listeners: HTTP on port 80
AZs: Select the subnets where both EC2s are running
Security Group: Allow inbound HTTP (port 80)
Forwarding rule: Forward to the Target Group you created

🔗 The Load Balancer will now accept user requests and forward them to either EC2 based on round-robin.

✅ Step-5: Access the Load Balancer DNS Name
Once the ALB is active:
Go to the Load Balancer details in AWS Console
Copy the DNS Name
Open it in a browser:,http://<your-alb-dns-name>

🎯 You’ll start seeing alternating outputs like:

Life Insurance Server - 1

Life Insurance Server - 2

Because the Load Balancer is sending requests to each server one after another — this is round robin load balancing.

❗ Note: Clean Up After Testing
✅ To avoid unnecessary charges:
Delete the Load Balancer
Delete the Target Group
Stop or terminate the EC2 instances

✅ Summary:
Step	Action	Purpose
1 & 2	Create EC2s with web pages	Acts as backend web servers
3	Create Target Group	Group servers for ALB to forward requests
4	Create ALB	Public access point with round-robin load distribution
5	Test via ALB DNS	Verifies successful load balancing
Final	Delete resources	Avoid AWS billing
