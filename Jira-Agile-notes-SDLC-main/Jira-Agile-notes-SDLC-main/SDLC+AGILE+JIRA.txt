### **Story**  
For task, a **user story** is created in JIRA to track the work that needs to be completed.  

### **Story Points**  
Story points are used to estimate the **effort and time required** to complete a story.  "Template of User Story is As a user, I want, So that"

This below example for points duration will vary

        - 1 day of work  â†’ 3 points  
        - 2 days of work â†’ 6 points  
        - 3 days of work â†’ 9 points  

**Note:** Every team member has access to JIRA to create and manage stories in the backlog.  

### **Sprint Planning**  
Sprint Planning is the process of selecting **stories** from the backlog to work on during the next sprint and time duration required to complete that.  

### **Sprint**  
A sprint is a **fixed time period (2 weeks to 4 weeks)** in which a team works on a set of selected user stories to **develop, test, and deliver** the features.  

#### **Status call / Standup meeting / Daily Standups (Scrum Calls) etc**
What they worked on yesterday
What they plan to do today
Any blockers or challenges


### **Retrospective meeting** is used to discuss about sprints feedback.

		- what went well
		- what went wrong
		- lessons learnt
		- new ideas to improvise next sprint
